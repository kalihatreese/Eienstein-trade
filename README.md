print("Three months ago, I coded a trading algorithm called Einstein Trade with the help of Bard.")
print("The algorithm is based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is a well-known mathematical pattern that has been shown to be effective in trading.")
print("The algorithm works by identifying Fibonacci retracements, which are pullbacks in the price of a security that occur after a strong move.")
print("We have backtested the algorithm on historical data and found that it has generated positive returns over a long period of time.")
print("However, it is important to note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.")
print("We are still in the early stages of developing Einstein Trade, but we are excited about the potential of this algorithm to help traders make profitable trades.")

# Additional features and explanations
print("\nAdditional Features and Explanations:")
print("1. The Fibonacci Sequence:")
print("   - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.")
print("   - The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next few numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.")
print("   - The Fibonacci sequence has been found to be present in many natural phenomena and is used in trading to identify support and resistance levels.")
print("2. Fibonacci Retracements:")
print("   - Fibonacci retracements are pullbacks in the price of a security that occur after a strong move.")
print("   - Common retracement levels include 23.6%, 38.2%, and 61.8%, used as support and resistance levels.")
print("3. How Einstein Trade Works:")
print("   - Einstein Trade uses the Fibonacci sequence to identify Fibonacci retracements.")
print("   - When the price of a security reaches a Fibonacci retracement level, the algorithm triggers a buy or sell signal.")
print("   - The algorithm also considers other factors, such as volatility and market sentiment, to generate high-probability signals.")

# Liquid Neural Network (LNN) Integration
